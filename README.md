# Shaoyao Route B2: reproducibility components

Version 0.2.0 publishes the **accepted-table reporting companion and dated data ledger** for a secondary transcriptomic study of Shaoyao–Gancao-related preparations and post-stroke spasticity. These are bounded, executable components, not the complete raw-to-model study pipeline. `.gitattributes` preserves the pinned bytes on Windows checkouts; earlier tags remain in history.

## What is available

- `pipeline/report.py`: original Python reporting code, standard library only.
- `data/derived/`: accepted GSE128623 (448 families) and JGW03 (123 families) aggregate reference tables.
- `expected/`: three fixed descriptive outputs for comparison.
- `MANIFEST.json`: SHA-256 identities of the release files.
- `data/ledger/`: the 15 October submitted-unit membership and reporting snapshots, their provenance, and the original metadata builder source.
- `pipeline/ledger.py`: export and verification of that dated metadata selection. See the [ledger guide](data/ledger/README.md) for later analyses and interpretation limits.

The derived tables are family-level aggregate outputs. The ledger adds public submitted-array/library identifiers and qualified analysis membership. Neither contains individual-level clinical records, raw sequencing data or third-party gene-set memberships.

## Run

From the repository directory, using Python 3.12 or later:

```sh
python -I -B pipeline/report.py --g128 data/derived/G128_FAMILY_SUMMARY.tsv --jgw data/derived/JGW_FAMILY_SUMMARY.tsv --output output
```

Use a new output directory. Compare the three named outputs with `expected/`. `RECEIPT.json` records the runtime and file identities. The reporting code and data are unchanged from the privately verified companion, which ran under Python 3.12.14 and reproduced the expected outputs byte-for-byte. This release does not claim testing on all later Python versions.

Verify the dated ledger independently of the reporting command:

```sh
python -I -B pipeline/ledger.py verify data/ledger
```

The verifier checks 165 submitted identifiers, 18 overlapping analysis specifications and nine reporting contracts across eight accessions. The identifiers do not establish 165 independent animals or cultures. GSE85871 selected membership remains unknown, not zero.

## Interpretation

The study's specified experimental-spasticity gate admitted 0 of 1,771 programs. Downstream candidate tests remained unevaluated. The published tables describe separate source-wide conditional-reference analyses; they are not independent biological or clinical validation. G128 empirical-q descriptors and JGW conditional-P descriptors retain different definitions and must not be pooled. Feature-family counts are not independent samples or necessarily unique genes.

The command computes descriptive groups from already accepted tables. It does not refit models, regenerate random allocations, recalculate P values or demonstrate an antispasticity mechanism. The study was not publicly preregistered. No independent outcome-protected PSS transcriptomic holdout has been established.

## Scope of this release

The complete study source archive, raw/intermediate data, manuscript, third-party resources and software dependency archives are not included in v0.2.0. Additional source modules require separate selection and provenance review. Whole-study cold restoration is not established by this release. The ledger is explicitly a 15 October metadata snapshot, not a complete log of later executions.
