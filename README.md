# Shaoyao Route B2: reproducibility components

Version 0.1.0 publishes the **accepted-table reporting companion** for a secondary transcriptomic study of Shaoyao–Gancao-related preparations and post-stroke spasticity. It is a bounded, executable component, not the complete raw-to-model study pipeline.

## What is available

- `pipeline/report.py`: original Python reporting code, standard library only.
- `data/derived/`: accepted GSE128623 (448 families) and JGW03 (123 families) aggregate reference tables.
- `expected/`: three fixed descriptive outputs for comparison.
- `MANIFEST.json`: SHA-256 identities of the release files.

These tables are family-level aggregate outputs. They contain neither individual-level clinical records nor raw sequencing data or third-party gene-set memberships.

## Run

From the repository directory, using Python 3.12 or later:

```sh
python -I -B pipeline/report.py --g128 data/derived/G128_FAMILY_SUMMARY.tsv --jgw data/derived/JGW_FAMILY_SUMMARY.tsv --output output
```

Use a new output directory. Compare the three named outputs with `expected/`. `RECEIPT.json` records the runtime and file identities. The reporting code and data are unchanged from the privately verified companion, which ran under Python 3.12.14 and reproduced the expected outputs byte-for-byte. This release does not claim testing on all later Python versions.

## Interpretation

The study's specified experimental-spasticity gate admitted 0 of 1,771 programs. Downstream candidate tests remained unevaluated. The published tables describe separate source-wide conditional-reference analyses; they are not independent biological or clinical validation. G128 empirical-q descriptors and JGW conditional-P descriptors retain different definitions and must not be pooled. Feature-family counts are not independent samples or necessarily unique genes.

The command computes descriptive groups from already accepted tables. It does not refit models, regenerate random allocations, recalculate P values or demonstrate an antispasticity mechanism. The study was not publicly preregistered. No independent outcome-protected PSS transcriptomic holdout has been established.

## Scope of this release

The complete study source archive, raw/intermediate data, manuscript, third-party resources and software dependency archives are not included in v0.1.0. Additional source modules require separate selection and provenance review. Whole-study cold restoration is not established by this release.
